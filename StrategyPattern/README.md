## StrategyPattern

# Definition
Defines a set of algorithms into family, encapsulate these algorithms, and make them interchangeable. This pattern is useful when the algorithms vary independently from the clients who use them.

# Design Principles

- Identify the aspects that vary and separate them from what is constant
- Program to an interface, not an implementation, i.e.
  - the declared type of the variables should be a supertype, usually an abstract class or interface, so that the objects assigned to those variables can be of any concrete implementation of the supertype, which means the class declaring them doesnâ€™t have to know about the actual object types
- Favor composition over inheritance (has-a is better than is-a)
  - composition: instead of inheriting algorithms, let an object have that algorithm
